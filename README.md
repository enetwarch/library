# [Library](https://enetwarch.github.io/library/)

A basic library that contains books. Heavily inspired from [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg). This simple web application replicates the basics of **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)** operations. 

> [!WARNING]
> The program might still have unresolved bugs.

### Books

The books I chose for this project are my favorite manhwas, including the popular Solo Leveling. I used [ComicK](https://comick.io/) as the source for the book covers as they have multiple covers to choose from. I also recommend getting your image URLs here if you plan on using this website.

> [!NOTE]
> Unrelated to the project, but I read my mangas/manhwas/manhuas using the [Mihon](https://mihon.app/) app. It is a free and open source fork of Tachiyomi.
